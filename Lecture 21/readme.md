# Higher order functions

A function inside a function is called a higher order function.

- To run the inner function return the inner function in a variable and call the function the variable.

- Variables of the outer functions are available inner function
- Variables of the inner function won't be available in the outer
- The arguments of the outer function are available in the inner function.

# Object Oriented Programming

- function dothings(x,y)
- let x=3
- let y=9
- dothings(x,y)

1. Encapsulation- It is the wrapping up of data types and function inside a unit.

2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance- It is a process by which the child object inherits all the properties from its parent and if there are many levels of inheritance it takes the nearest value of a variable that's present
4. Polymorphism

# ES6 Classes

- There is nothing like a class in JS.
- There are only objects.

```
// by the constructing the object
function(name, age)
{
    this.age=age
    this.name=name
}
let a={
}
```

- To give a value to the variables of a object we have to use constructor.

- To use a constructor we have to use ES6 classes


## Proto and prototype

- We create b from a

```
__proto__ means the parent of the current object
```

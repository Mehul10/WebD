# DOM (Document object Model)

- Document- HTML Webpage
- object - OOPS 
- DOM- Document object model means that we are considering each document or HTML webpage as a object.

```
document.body
document.title
```

## DOM Objects

1. document.getElementsByTagName('p')
2. document.getElementsById('abc')
3. document.getElementsByClassName('class1')


To get elements from the HTML documents we can use the above three method and to access the content that is inside of this HTML we can use functions like innerText and innerHTML
```
<script defer src='./index.js'></script>
```

- defer- it delays the running of the javascript code untill all of the HTML is rendered.
